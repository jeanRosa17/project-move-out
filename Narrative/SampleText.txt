#start {
	It’s been a bit since I got to work, but this job should be easy, not many things to fit in my van.
	I can move with wsad and pick objects up with space, I’ll be done as soon as I move everything on the list I was given.
}

#enterLivingRoom {
	I was told to leave the table and shelf, I guess this guy rents furniture as well.
}

#firstEnterVan {
	I can’t stack these lazily, re-arranging it all to make everything fit is a pain.
}

#firstEnterBathroom {
	Doesn’t look like I need to move anything in here. 
	That bathtub looks like it has more spells than it needs anyways.
}

#interactKitchen {
	That's a lot of alcohol, I suppose he's one of those party folk.
}

#pickUpTV {
	I don’t understand these new models, they barely look better and cost three times as much. 
	Shows nowadays are bad anyways, I prefer SoundBoxes.
}

#pickupMattress {
	No partner, otherwise he wouldn’t be allowed to sleep on the floor....
	...It is pretty efficient.
}

#couch {
	When I was your age, couches were hard.
	They built character goddamnit.
}

#null {
	No problem here.
}
