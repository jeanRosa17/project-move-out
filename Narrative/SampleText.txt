#start {
	It’s been a bit since I got to work, but this job should be easy, not many things to fit in my van.
	I can move with wsad and pick objects up with space, once I'm done I can hit the lever on my truck to leave.
}

#enterLivingRoom {
	I was told to leave the table and shelf, I guess this guy rents furniture as well.
}

#firstEnterVan {
	I can’t stack these lazily, re-arranging it all to make everything fit is a pain.
}

#firstEnterBathroom {
	Doesn’t look like I need to move anything in here. 
	That bathtub looks like it has more spells than it needs anyways.
}

#interactKitchen {
	That's a lot of alcohol, I suppose he's one of those party folk.
}

#pickUpTV {
	I don’t understand these new models, they barely look better and cost three times as much. 
	Shows nowadays are bad anyways, I prefer SoundBoxes.
}

#pickupMattress {
	No partner, otherwise he wouldn’t be allowed to sleep on the floor....
	...It is pretty efficient.
}

#couch {
	When I was your age, couches were hard.
	They built character goddamnit.
}

#null {
	No problem here.
}

#fratEnter {
	Magic may have gotten more advanced, but the yung 'uns shouldn't sling it around willy-nilly.
	I'll have to work around all the wind. *sigh*
}

#poolEnter {
	Why any child would want to come here is beyond me.
	That's probably why they called me here, come to think of it.
}

#hauntedEnter {
	If all the furniture can move itself, why do they need me?!
	Perhaps it will all calm down if I find the source of the haunting. I should charge extra for this.
}

#apartmentEnter {
	It seems not everyone is leaving, so I was given a list of objects to move.
	Best not to deviate from it, I'll probably be sued for that.
}

#iceEnter {
	It's a good thing my cloak is made of good wool, I don't want to know what happened here.
	I left my spiked boots at home, I'll just deal with the ice.
}
