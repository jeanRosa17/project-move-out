#start {
	This sure is a mess, I understand why they rushed me on the phone. 
	I’d best be careful on that ice, my boots aren’t made for walking on it.
}

#objectiveReminder {
	They said that some of their furniture was damaged or rented. 
	I wouldn’t want to repair anything in that kitchen either. 
	It’d be best to make sure nothing else gets damaged.
}

#firstTouchIce {
	Brrr, I should have brought a coat.
}

#firstMoveDesk {
	These designs seem like a waste of time, but I suppose it pays rent.
}

#firstRentedObject {
	Everyone is renting furniture, when I was young nobody would wase a hand-cast piece of work.
}

#firstBedroomEnter {
	I’ll have to get all this across the ice. 
	Suppose I’ll also need hot tea with dinner.
}

#touchFridge {
	Why am I touching this freezing thing?
}
